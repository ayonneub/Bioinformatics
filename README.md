 Assembling Genomes from short reads
Here, I assemble the reference genome from reference reads (contains 10 millions lines, each line has 10 data containing 0,1,2,3. I process that data into 0='A', 1='C', 2='G', 3= 'T') and muted genome from muted reads (contains 10 millions lines, each line has 10 data containing 0,1,2,3. I process that data into 0='A', 1='C', 2='G', 3= 'T') using de bruijn algorithms.

After solving this problem I started loving to learn and code in this field.

[Because of 190 MB + 191 MB size of dataset, I could not able to upload it in github.]
